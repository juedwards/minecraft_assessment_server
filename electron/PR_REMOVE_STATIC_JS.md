PR: remove tracked static JS and rely on TypeScript sources

Summary
-------
This PR removes the legacy, tracked JavaScript files under `electron/static` and relies on the TypeScript source + the new static bundling step (`static/dist/bundle.js`). The bundle is built during `npm run build` and `static/dist/` is ignored.

What this PR contains
- Deleted tracked legacy JS files under `electron/static` (list in `remove_static_js_list.txt`).
- Guarantee: `static/dist/bundle.js` is generated by CI and included in the packaged electron artifact.

QA checklist (manual)
---------------------
- [ ] Build passes (CI ran `npm run build`).
- [ ] Viewer launches without console errors.
- [ ] 3D scene renders and player updates work.
- [ ] Event log shows place/break events.
- [ ] Rubric editor and export buttons behave as before.

Rollback plan
-------------
- The backup folder `electron/static/_legacy_js_backup` contains the removed files if needed. Restoring is a simple file move and commit rollback.

Notes
-----
- This PR will not include any automated git operations. The deletion script `scripts/prepare-remove-static-js.js` is included to help maintainers perform the removals locally when ready.
